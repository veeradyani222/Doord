About Me:
I am Veer Adyani ‚Äî a passionate and detail-focused full-stack developer from Indore, India, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science (2023-2027) at Chameli Devi Group of Institutions. I specialize in the MERN stack, crafting responsive, high-performance web applications with a strong focus on UI/UX, backend architecture, database optimization, security, and scalability. I handle projects end-to-end, from design to deployment, blending creativity with robust technical implementation.
In terms of experience, I‚Äôve worked on real-world freelance projects:
‚Ä¢	At W EVER CLASSES (Sep 2024 ‚Äì Nov 2024, Hybrid/Remote from Indore), I worked as a Freelance Full-Stack Developer where I built a comprehensive e-commerce platform from scratch using the MERN stack. I integrated features like cart, wishlist, reviews, admin panel, secure payments, and optimized the database for large-scale performance. I independently handled the UI/UX, backend, APIs, and deployment ‚Äî delivering a feature-rich and scalable platform.
‚Ä¢	Since April 2025, I‚Äôve been a Freelance Backend Developer for DOORD (Canada). I developed the core REST APIs for user authentication, order creation, and service filtering. I collaborated with frontend and chat integration teams to build real-time, seamless experiences. I designed MongoDB schemas optimized for user roles, services, and live order tracking, ensuring clean, modular, and scalable code.
