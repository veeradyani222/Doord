About Me:
I am Veer Adyani ‚Äî a passionate and detail-focused full-stack developer from Indore, India, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science (2023-2027) at Chameli Devi Group of Institutions. I specialize in the MERN stack, crafting responsive, high-performance web applications with a strong focus on UI/UX, backend architecture, database optimization, security, and scalability. I handle projects end-to-end, from design to deployment, blending creativity with robust technical implementation.
In terms of experience, I‚Äôve worked on real-world freelance projects:
‚Ä¢	At W EVER CLASSES (Sep 2024 ‚Äì Nov 2024, Hybrid/Remote from Indore), I worked as a Freelance Full-Stack Developer where I built a comprehensive e-commerce platform from scratch using the MERN stack. I integrated features like cart, wishlist, reviews, admin panel, secure payments, and optimized the database for large-scale performance. I independently handled the UI/UX, backend, APIs, and deployment ‚Äî delivering a feature-rich and scalable platform.
‚Ä¢	Since April 2025, I‚Äôve been a Freelance Backend Developer for DOORD (Canada). I developed the core REST APIs for user authentication, order creation, and service filtering. I collaborated with frontend and chat integration teams to build real-time, seamless experiences. I designed MongoDB schemas optimized for user roles, services, and live order tracking, ensuring clean, modular, and scalable code.
I‚Äôve also created impactful projects like:

Email Requirements:
Professional subject line that directly relates to my candidacy for ${application.jobTitle}.

Email body should:

Align my skills, experience, and projects directly to the job description.

Clearly articulate how I can contribute immediate value to the company‚Äôs mission and goals.

Highlight my key projects (with links) to showcase relevant expertise.

Express enthusiasm and respect for the founder's vision.

End with a polite call to action (e.g., expressing openness to discuss or interview further).

Maintain professional yet warm tone, under 4 concise paragraphs.

Include line breaks where necessary for readability.

Avoid generic statements ‚Äî personalize based on the role and my experience.
Also include my GitHub link at the end along with the portfolio link.
"When including any links, insert them directly as hyperlinks in the text without prefacing them with phrases like 'Here is the link:' or 'Link:' or 'GitHub link:'. The links should be seamlessly embedded within the sentence."

ALSO I REPEAT-  Generate a professional, concise, and human-like cold email without adding any introductory remarks about the email itself. Do not include meta-comments like "Here's a professional email" or formatting markers such as ***, --- or Subject:. The email should flow naturally without unnecessary markers. Avoid making claims that aren't provided, such as "I have attached my resume." Keep the tone polished, personalized, and directly relevant to the provided data, making it seem as if written thoughtfully by an experienced candidate. Maintain proper structure with a polite greeting, body, and a professional closing ‚Äî all styled formally yet approachable.


Also pls if u dont have some data u wanna write about in the message and u dont have it from my prompt, just manaeg it rather than leaving spaces for me to fill or replace. pls understand that your response will be a part of an automadted functionality so no human interference will be done to hyour answer.

### About Me:
I am Veer Adyani ‚Äî a passionate and detail-focused full-stack developer from Indore, India, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science (2023-2027) at Chameli Devi Group of Institutions. I specialize in the MERN stack, crafting responsive, high-performance web applications with a strong focus on UI/UX, backend architecture, database optimization, security, and scalability. I handle projects end-to-end, from design to deployment, blending creativity with robust technical implementation.
In terms of experience, I‚Äôve worked on real-world freelance projects:
‚Ä¢	At W EVER CLASSES (Sep 2024 ‚Äì Nov 2024, Hybrid/Remote from Indore), I worked as a Freelance Full-Stack Developer where I built a comprehensive e-commerce platform from scratch using the MERN stack. I integrated features like cart, wishlist, reviews, admin panel, secure payments, and optimized the database for large-scale performance. I independently handled the UI/UX, backend, APIs, and deployment ‚Äî delivering a feature-rich and scalable platform.
‚Ä¢	Since April 2025, I‚Äôve been a Freelance Backend Developer for DOORD (Canada). I developed the core REST APIs for user authentication, order creation, and service filtering. I collaborated with frontend and chat integration teams to build real-time, seamless experiences. I designed MongoDB schemas optimized for user roles, services, and live order tracking, ensuring clean, modular, and scalable code.
I‚Äôve also created impactful projects like:
‚Ä¢	W EVER CLASSES Website: An e-commerce site for CA courses with dashboards, admin management, and secure payments.
